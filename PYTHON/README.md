File "from_openaq_to_sql.py" 
- is an example of how you can retrieve data from the OpenAQ API using Python and pandas, and then load it into a SQL Server table.

In this example, you need to replace 'MyDatabaseName', 'MyUsername', and 'MyPassword' with My actual SQL Server database credentials. Also, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, pyodbc, and requests) by running pip install pandas pyodbc requests in My Python environment.

The script makes a GET request to the OpenAQ API, specifying the country parameter as 'UA' for Ukraine and the limit parameter as the desired number of records to retrieve. It retrieves the response data as JSON and converts it to a pandas DataFrame. Then, it establishes a connection to SQL Server using pyodbc and writes the data from the DataFrame to the specified table using the to_sql method.

Make sure to adjust the code according to My specific requirements and API response structure. You may need to map the JSON data fields to the corresponding table columns in order to ensure proper data insertion.
